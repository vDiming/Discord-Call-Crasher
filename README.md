# Discord-Call-Crasher
Proxyless Discord Call Crasher (Created By Jonah)

# Requirements / Setting up
There will be a few things you will need in order to run this program on your machine.
1. Downloading The Repository
   - There will be a bright green button which says "Code" on the top right of this repo. Click it and click download as zip, and once it downloads extract it to your desktop.
 
2. Python 3+
   - You will need to install Python 3.x from the Python website. [Click here for latest version.](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.0/python-3.10.0-amd64.exe)  
   Once it is installed, you will need to open the setup and on the first page click the box that says "ADD PYTHON TO PATH". This is crucial because it ensures that you will have pip.

3. Downloading Python Packages
   - Open setup.py

# Running The Crasher
Open crash.py, it will ask you for your Discord Token. You then need to get the Channel ID of the user or group chat channel. To do that open Discord on your browser and click the user or group chat on the 'direct messages' list. Then in the URL it will show the Channel ID it will look like this 'https://discord.com/channels/@me/xxxxxxxxxxxxxx'. Copy ONLY the ID not the entire URL. Finally you can enter the amount of requests you want to send, I would recommended 1000 but if you want to crash the call for a long time do 10000+.
